 * @brief This is a driver that allows the Propeller Multicore Microcontroller to 
 * draw text, shapes, and bitmap files on various screens and displays.
 *
 * @detail This helper-library allows the Propeller Multicore Microcontroller to 
 * draw pixels, lines, circles, recatngles, rounded rectagles, triangles, formatted text 
 * in multiple fonts, bitmap images stored on an SD card on various screens and displays. 
 * At Parallax, we would like to thank Adafruit Industries as parts of this library 
 * were dervied from the Adafruit GFX library for Arduino.  Please submit bug reports, 
 * suggestions, and improvements to this code to editor@parallax.com.
 * 
 * @note If fonts are installed, they occupy EEPROM addresses 40576 to 63359.
